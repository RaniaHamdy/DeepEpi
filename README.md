# DeepEpi
deep learning framework to predict gene expression from histone modification using variation model of LSTM and CNN with aid of attention mechanism


# Dataset 
DeepEPI used datase from Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium (REMC) database from the Roadmap Epigenomics Projects but used after preprocessing from another previous work mentioned in the paper, 
The original dataset can be downloaded from this [repository](https://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/web_portal/processed_data.html)
The dataset after preprocessing can be downloaded from this [repository](https://github.com/ly-zhu/CRNN-gene-expression-with-histone-modifications)
