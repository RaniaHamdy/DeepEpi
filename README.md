# DeepEpi
deep learning framework to predict gene expression from histone modification using variation model of LSTM and CNN with aid of attention mechanism


# Dataset 
DeepEPI used datase from Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium (REMC) database from the Roadmap Epigenomics Projects. The original dataset can be downloaded from this [repository](https://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/web_portal/processed_data.html).
The dataset used after preprocessing from another previous work mentioned in the paper and can be downloaded from this [repository](https://github.com/ly-zhu/CRNN-gene-expression-with-histone-modifications)
